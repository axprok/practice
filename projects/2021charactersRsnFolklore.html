        <h3>Characters in Russian Folklore (fall 2021)</h3>

        <p>
        Our Research Question
        <br>
        How can we contextualize Russian culture by analyzing the frequency of
        certain types of characters appearing in folklore?
        Through distant reading analysis, we will attempt to draw conclusions about the roles of characters in Russian
        folklore. Using these conclusions, we can make tentative assumptions about broader Russian culture
        </p>

        <p>
        Our Methods
        <br>
        - The source texts Analyzed were pulled from the Project Gutenberg website. These texts were already translated into English for ease of understanding the data
        - An estimated 50 different folktales were used for this project
        - We will be keeping a particular eye out for specific characters and names, as well as actions (verbs)
